# 🔱 UMBRA | CAUSAL INTERVENTION PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (POC)

**A Real-Time Anomaly Signal from the Nexus Intervensi Kausal (NIK) Architecture.**

---

This repository serves as a verifiable, time-stamped artifact proving the operational capability of the Umbra Agency to perform **Causal Intervention**.

### ⚙️ The Purpose of this Data

The file `realtime_anomaly_signal.json` is not a typical market report. It is a snapshot of data fusion (Global Cargo Logistics Data & Real-World Asset (RWA) Pricing) calculated by our **UmbraQuant** analysis engine.

* **Anomaly Signal:** The data highlights a current divergence in the global supply chain, specifically an upward price pressure in CPO Futures (a major Asian commodity), which signals increased volatility and a need for secure data management in the logistics sector.
* **Strategic Action:** This data anomaly is the **Causal Trigger** used to justify a tactical, low-capital entry point into the SCM (Supply Chain Management) Token market (LINK/Chainlink) for Liquidity Arbitrage.

This POC demonstrates that the system does not just *predict* the future, but *intervenes* and *acts* upon proprietary signals.
